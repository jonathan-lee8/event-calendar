# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This work day scheduler has been created by three components of code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User can plan out their schedule for the day.
The timing is represented by past, present, and future in color coordination so user can clearly see if the time of their scheduled event/reminder has passed.
The description of what their schedule is will be saved into the local storage once user puts an input into the description and clicks the save button.
